### Setting a Pattern

There you can select a pattern to apply instead of a gradient. Only the first and last colors configured in a gradient will be used for the pattern.

### Applying to Shapes

With the tool selected, click a shape to apply the gradient:

While the tool is selected, you will see control points on the shapes that have gradients. You can move these to adjust the gradient.
